`@victor-software-house/pi-multicodex` is a pi extension for rotating multiple ChatGPT Codex OAuth accounts when using the `openai-codex-responses` API.

Current behavior:

- rotates on quota and rate-limit failures
- prefers untouched accounts when usage data is available
- otherwise prefers the account whose weekly window resets first
- stays focused on Codex only

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:@victor-software-house/pi-multicodex
```

Restart `pi` after installation.

## Local development

This repo uses `mise` to pin tool versions and `pnpm` for dependency management.

```bash
mise install
pnpm install
pnpm check
```

Equivalent mise tasks:

```bash
mise run install
mise run check
mise run pack-dry
```

Run the extension directly during local development:

```bash
pi -e ./index.ts
```

## Commands

- `/multicodex-login <email>`
  - Add or update a Codex account in the rotation pool.
- `/multicodex-use`
  - Select an account manually for the current session.
- `/multicodex-status`
  - Show account state and cached usage information.

## Status

This package is being turned into an independent fork with deliberate breaking changes.

Current direction:

- package name: `@victor-software-house/pi-multicodex`
- hard break from previous storage compatibility
- Codex-only scope
- independent implementation roadmap tracked in `fork-plan.md`

## Release validation

Local development uses pnpm, but published package output must remain npm-compatible.

Minimum release checks:

```bash
pnpm check
npm pack --dry-run
```

Recommended release flow:

1. For the first publish of a brand-new package, publish manually from a trusted local machine.
2. After the package exists on npm, configure npm trusted publishing for `.github/workflows/publish.yml`.
3. Publish subsequent releases by pushing a matching `v*` git tag.

Bootstrap publish:

```bash
npm run publish:dry -- <version>
npm publish --access public --otp=<code>
```

Trusted publishing flow after bootstrap:

```bash
git tag v<version>
git push origin v<version>
```
